liblinux
========

liblinux is a static C library to abstract away all assembly needed to
interface with the Linux kernel. To use the C headers at least a C99 compiler
is required (C11 is recommended).

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------
Currently supported are:
- x86
- x32
- x86_64
- arm64

REQUIRED ASSEMBLERS
-------------------
x86, x32 and x86_64: NASM (Netwide Assembler)
arm64: gas (GNU Assembler)

BUILDING & INSTALLATION
-----------------------
To build a version of the library, run
    make [CONFIG=filename.mk] <command>
Valid commands:
    help      - this help message
    build     - builds the library
    test      - builds the library and runs the test suite
    clean     - removes all previously build files
    install   - copies the headers and all previously build libraries to (DESTDIR)(PREFIX)
    uninstall - removes the headers and all previously build libraries from (DESTDIR)(PREFIX)
You need to specfiy a config file to build or install the library or you can create a default config file named 'config.mk'.

You can build multiple versions of the library as long as you use a different
TARGET name for each (or they will just replace eachother)

If you install the library without building it first, only the headers will be copied.

BUGS
----
None known.

ROADMAP
-------
- For every architecture added, increase the minor version number, until all architectures are supported which marks the 1.0.0 release.
- Support different assemblers for maximum portability.
