liblinux_syscall
================

liblinux_syscall is a static C library to abstract away all assembly needed to
interface with the Linux kernel. To use the C headers at least a C99 compiler is
required (C11 is recommended).

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------
Supported architectures can be queried by running
$ make

Currently supported are:
- i386
- x86_64
- arm64

REQUIRED ASSEMBLERS
-------------------
i386 and x86_64: NASM (Netwide Assembler)
arm64: gas (GNU Assembler)

BUILDING
--------
To build the library, run
$ make <arch>
And to install the library, run
# make [PREFIX=<path>] install
The default prefix is /usr/local.

TESTING
-------
First, build the library. Then run
$ make test

BUGS
----
None known.

ROADMAP
-------
- For every architecture added, increase the minor version number, until all architectures are supported which marks the 1.0.0 release.
- Support different assemblers for maximum portability.
