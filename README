liblinux_syscall
================

liblinux_syscall is a static C library to abstract away all assembly needed to
interface with the Linux kernel. To use the C headers at least a C99 compiler is
required (C11 is recommended).

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------
Currently supported are:
- x86
- x32
- x86_64
- arm64

REQUIRED ASSEMBLERS
-------------------
x86, x32 and x86_64: NASM (Netwide Assembler)
arm64: gas (GNU Assembler)

BUILDING
--------
To build a version of the library, run
    make [option=value ...] <arch>
where "option" can be: (multiple option=value pairs can be provided by separating them with spaces)
    TARGET  - the name of the library (default: liblinux_syscall.a)
    AS      - name of the assembler program to use (default depends on the architecture)
    ASFLAGS - additional flags passed to the assembler (default depends on the architecture)
    AR      - name of the archiver program to use (default depends on the architecture)
    ARFLAGS - commands passed to the archiver (default depends on the architecture)
and "arch" can be one of:
    x86
    x32
    x86_64
    arm64

You can build multiple versions of the library as long as you use a different name for each (or
they will just replace eachother)

INSTALLATION
------------
To (un)install the library, run
    make [option=value ...] command
where "option" can be: (multiple option=value pairs can be provided by separating them with spaces)
    DESTDIR   - overrides the destination directory for the installation (default is empty)
    PREFIX    - the installation prefix (default: /usr/local)
and "command" can be one of:
    install   - copies the headers and all previously build libraries to (DESTDIR)(PREFIX)
    uninstall - removes the headers and all previously build libraries from (DESTDIR)(PREFIX)

If you install the library without building it first, only the headers will be copied.

TESTING
-------
TODO

BUGS
----
None known.

ROADMAP
-------
- For every architecture added, increase the minor version number, until all architectures are supported which marks the 1.0.0 release.
- Support different assemblers for maximum portability.
