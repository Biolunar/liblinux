liblinux_syscall
================

liblinux_syscall is a static C library to abstract away all assembly needed to
interface with the Linux kernel. To use the C headers at least a C99 compiler is
required (C11 is recommended). To buid the library the Netwide Assembler (NASM)
is required.

BUILDING
--------
Supported architectures can be determined by executing
$ make
Currently only i386 and x86_64 are supported.

To build the library, execute
$ make <arch>
And to install the library, execute
# make [PREFIX=<path>] install
The default prefix is /usr/local.
