liblinux
========

liblinux is a static C library to abstract away all assembly needed to
interface with the Linux kernel. To use the C headers a C11 compiler is
required.

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------
Currently supported are:
- arm-eabi
- arm64
- x86
- x32
- x86_64

Supported ASSEMBLERS
--------------------
arm-eabi, arm64: gas (GNU Assembler)
x86, x32 and x86_64: NASM (Netwide Assembler), gas (GNU Assembler)

BUILDING & INSTALLATION
-----------------------
To build the library, run
    make [CONFIG=filename.mk] [command]
Valid commands:
    all (default) - build the library
    clean         - remove all previously build files
    test          - build the library and run the test suite
    install       - copy the headers and the library to $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)
    uninstall     - remove the headers and the library from $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)

You can build multiple versions of the library as long as you use a different
$(TARGET) name for each (or they will just replace eachother)

BUGS
----
None known.

ROADMAP
-------
- Implement the vsyscalls for x86.
- Add all constants and types needed to use the syscalls.
- Complete the test suite.
- Bump version to 1.0.
